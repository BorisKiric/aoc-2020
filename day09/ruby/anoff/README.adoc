== Part 1

Decided to implement the low level tests as well for the moving window validator and paid off I would say.
First validated my `validNumber?` method and then went on to do the looping and in the end my first syntax-free solution worked correctly!

Had some issues with indexing arrays (only `Range`s work but not arrays of indexes).
