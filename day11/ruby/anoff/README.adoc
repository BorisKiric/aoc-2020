== Part 1

Yay game of life!

The only part I had to think about a bit was how to deal with the whole _look at all seats at once and make up their future state before applying it_ thing.
Decided to just create a temporary seatmap cloned from the current where I modify the seats and then replace the map of the original instance.

Again learned that testing is super helpful.. had a stupid mistake again where I checked for `>4` occupied seats instead of `>= 4` seats.
The first test cases I wrote were fine with this but the final one caught the error.

Also messed up x/y at one point and that only caused an error with the real input not with the test inputs..
