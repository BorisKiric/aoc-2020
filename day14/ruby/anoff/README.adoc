== Part 1

Might have worked with string ops too but decided to go for the binary operator approach.
To make sure that all `0` in the mask end up as `0` in the value, turn the X->1 and use a binary and `&` operator.
For the `1` do the logical opposite - turn X->0 and use OR.

To make sure I store all numbers and allow overwriting I use a ruby hash and use the memory pool address as hash key.

This was a fun regex exercise :)
