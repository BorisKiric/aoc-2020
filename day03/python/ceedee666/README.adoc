== Day 03

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution::
* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

The main idea of this solution is to use modular arithmetics to calculate the
y coordinate of the trajectory. The calculation of the x coordinate is performed
using the `range` function and an optional `step`. 

To calculate the and y coordinates it is important to note, that it is not dependant 
on the x coordinate but rather on the iteration step. Therefore, I use 
the `enumerate` function to associate each x coordinate to count of the iteration.
For this, the y coordinates can simply be calculates as 
of each trajectory can easily be calculate from the step size, the iteration count and
the length of one row.
