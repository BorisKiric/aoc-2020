== Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory  ==

This solution is written in Groovy.

The original puzzle can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3 .
The source code can be found at https://github.com/docToolchain/aoc-2020/tree/main/day03/groovy/rdmueller .

For execution enter `./solution.groovy` in the command line.
This is possible because I looked up the right shebang for the first line of the file to tell bash to use groovy.

=== Read File

To read and parse the file in groovy is not as trivial as yesterday.
I parse the file to a map which makes it easy and fast to iterate over it.
