== Part 1

Oh god graphs again!

Unsure how to build up the graph though I opted for a graph-esque solution.
I built a class `Bag` that can take the list of all baggage rules and then populate a local array with all the bags that can be stored in the `Bag` instance.
This is done recursively for any `Bag` that does not have this list populated yet.

In the end it is just counting the number of items in the instance of the shiny gold `Bag`.
