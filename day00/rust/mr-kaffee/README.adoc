= Day 0 =

I'll try to solve this year's edition with https://rust-lang.org[Rust].

All days should run using `cargo run`.
I also plan to add some simple tests based on the example data from the puzzle descriptions which can be executed using `cargo test`.

Tests are implemented in the same source file with the code in a separate `tests` module which is excluded from the regular binary:

[sourc,rust,numbered]
....
include::src/main.rs[tags=test]
....
