== Day 2: Password Philosophy

After I had a look how others solved Day01 in Python using functional programming I decided to also give this a try.
Hence I did my first functional programming baby steps today.

I could have turned the information per line into a dictionary but decided to go  with a simple list.
I also realized that read_input_file() should not rely on extractPasswordInformation() but decided to keep this as it is.
