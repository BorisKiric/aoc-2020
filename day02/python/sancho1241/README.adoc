== Day 02

== Parsing

Need to do some more parsing, like removing unnecessary characters, split the lines and cast the numbers to int

== Algorithm

Star1: Count the occurences of the char in each password and check if it's within boundaries
Star2: Apply XOR condition


== Today I learned
- Got confused with list indexes, maybe should've used dictionary for better readability of the code
- that the enumerate function in Python iterates through the list and also provides the list index, so no need for an extra counter
- I can make my code script shorter by concatenate method calls
- I can have multiple operators in a row in an if condition
- Recalled the boolean XOR operation for Part 2
- Gitpod Debugger does not work since input file not found. I assume it's a configuration issue in the JSON
