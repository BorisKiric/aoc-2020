Joining for my first Aoc experience.

== Day 01

== Usage

Data is read from the file 'expenseResport.txt' which shall contain one expense value per line

== How does it work

The expenses are read into a list expenses. The outer loop grabs an expense value from the list and iterates with the inner loops through all subsequent values searching for a match according to the day01 task.
