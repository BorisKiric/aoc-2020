== Day 1: Report Repair  ==

This solution is written in Kotlin.

The original puzzle can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1

For execution enter _kotlin day2001_1_2.kts_ in the command line.

=== First Star

How does it work: +

First invoke a function:
[source, kotlin, numbered]
....
include::day2001_1_2.kts[tags=part_1]
....


This function is reading puzzle_input twice in a nested loop, add both values, if sum is 2020 return the result:
[source, kotlin, numbered]
....
include::day2001_1_2.kts[tags=add_two_coins]
....

=== Second Star

How does it work: +

Here also invoke a function:
[source, kotlin, numbered]
....
include::day2001_1_2.kts[tags=part_2]
....

The function works the same way, only that it has three nestet loops:
[source, kotlin, numbered]
....
include::day2001_1_2.kts[tags=add_three_coins]
....

Finally, print out the solution for both puzzles:
[source, kotlin, numbered]
....
include::day2001_1_2.kts[tags=output]
....
